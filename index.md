title: Welcome

This blog has been just started and will be filled up with content and instructions for code assets stored on my [GitHub](https://github.com/StrictLine/). At first articles about DevOps for AuCRM (Aurea CRM) will be published, later on I might provide tutorials on demand.

### TODOs
1. Define the main categories
2. Apply fonts & additional styles
3. Finalize welcome text
4. Schedule frequency of posting new blog articles

> Feel free to send me a message at [feedback@strictline.biz](mailto:feedback@example.com) with your valuable feedback.
